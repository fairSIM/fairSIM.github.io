title: SIM using a DMD and a coherent light source
do_not_link: true
---

A compact and cost-effective SIM system, constructed using inexpensive,
industry-grade components (laser light source, camera) and a digital
micro-mirror device (DMD), acting as a phase modulator to create the
SIM pattern.

The sawtooth pattern of the micro-mirrors give rise to a blazed grating
effect. As SIM uses coherent light to achieve destructive interference
and thus high modulation contrast, this effect has to be taken into
account when constructing a SIM microscope using a DMD.
